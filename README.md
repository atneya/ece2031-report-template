#  ECE2031 LaTeX Report Template
LaTeX template for ECE2031 lab reports at Georgia Tech. 

## How to Use
The [template](template.tex) file is the main template file, which contains 
examples for the various result formatting types needed over the course of the semester. The file is well commented, and only 
replacement of the caption text and figure filenames should be required. The [results folder](results/) contains demo figures
and code (copyright reserved to course instructors), which were given as examples in the course provided template, 
along with some of the caption text in the template.

## How to Compile
Compile with your choice of LaTeX distribution, but MikTex, or texliveonfly
is recommended as there are several package and font dependencies (texlive-extra should include almost all of them).

## Template Output
The compiled output of the template is shown as an example at [pdf](template.pdf)

## Development
I made this template while taking the course to simplify lab report writing (and since I greatly prefer LaTeX to Word).
If the formatting specification changes or new results types are added, feel free to fork this repo and modify the template.

Go Jackets!
